# ProcessorSimulator
A program to simulate a processor with various numbers of cores.

This program was written to simulate a processor given an input. 
The input includes the number of cores as well as a set of processes.
A process consists of a process ID and a list of instructions, each with an execution time.
These instructions are read by the program and "executed".
The goal is to find the total time simulated after all programs are finished running.

The program is compiled with g++ and takes input through I/O redirection.
